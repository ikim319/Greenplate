# Project Description
This semester's project is "GreenPlate: A Sustainable Food Management System." GreenPlate is dedicated
to fostering sustainable eating and shopping habits. The app's design focuses on reducing food waste and
promoting efficient use of resources. Through this project, users can actively contribute to a more
sustainable lifestyle. The Food Tracker app allows users to track daily calorie intake, create recipes,
manage ingredient quantities, and generate shopping lists.
Key features include secure account creation, an intuitive interface with meal logging and calories
tracking, a database of recipes with integrated ingredient inventory monitoring, pantry quantity
management, and shopping list population based on missing recipe ingredients. The app will make it so
that the users have actionable insights related to recipes, ingredients, and purchasing needs required for
upcoming meals. The food tracking system improves grocery shopping, dieting, and daily food
preparation.
Your project will be implemented across four sprints.
